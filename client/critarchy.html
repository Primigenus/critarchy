    <p class="intro">We're designing a new way for artists to share their work, get feedback,
      and most importantly, get better. Right now, we're focusing on two things:
      critiques and sketchbooks.</p>
    <h3>Critiques</h3>
    <p>Critiques are all about posting your work and getting feedback so you can improve. When you post your art,
    people can reply with critiques. The idea here is that great art gets even better with great
    crits. This isn't a place to post your work if all you're looking for is a pat on the back. We believe
    in constructive, in-depth feedback and think this should be the place you go to find that.</p>
    <h3>Sketchbooks</h3>
    <p>We think seeing artists' work in the context of their overall
      improvement helps generate better crits. So sketchbooks are all about sharing your work over time.
      They allow you to see and share how you're getting better. When you visit someone's
      sketchbook, you see their work in reverse chronological order and can scroll through to see
      how they've improved and leave comments or thanks when you see something great. You can still post
      artwork separately - for instance, if you want some focused feedback just on that piece.</p>
    <h3>Thanks</h3>
    <p>When you leave critiques or comment on something, others can thank you.
      "Thanks" are the currency of Critarchy; the more thanks you've received,
      the more reputation you have in the community. We want this to be a place you go because
      you know you'll be able to browse great art, and leave and receive great feedback. We hope the
      thanks system will inspire you to both post your art and leave critiques.</p>

    <h3>Why is it called Critarchy?</h3>
    <p>A <a href="http://voluntaryist.com/forthcoming/kritarchy.html#.VOLS5lPN8m8">kritarchy</a>
      is a form of government without political rule. Our vision is of a community for artists
      designed by and for its members that doesn't
      impose any forced business models or ad schemes. We'd like to try
      building it. Calling it "Critarchy" is our punny way of referencing this while
      still focusing on the most important thing: great critiques of great art.</p>

    <h3>Why not just make a forum?</h3>
    <p>Forums are great for discussion. We're building something different - a place for
      great critiques. The number one focus is on artists exchanging feedback with each other,
      not on people having conversations. We still think artists should have a forum where
      they can talk about anything, it just isn't what we're working on.</p>

    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p>We are <a href="http://dierat.com">Diedra</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rahul">Rahul</a>.
    Diedra is an artist who, over the years, has been a member of many artists'
    communities and as such has seen her fair share of how things work (and how they break). Rahul
    is a user interface designer and software engineer who was inspired by Diedra's rants and a
    discussion on Facebook to build this. We're just getting started. Let's see where things take us!</p>
